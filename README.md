# Bioimage-processing-hub
## About Our Facility
The **Bioimage Processing Hub (BIPHUB)** is a collaborative effort intended to provide a resource that supports microscopists at the imaging nodes across Oslo. My role will be to help users develop image analysis pipelines.
Whether you're working with datasets from the Montebello Node, Blindern Node, IMB node, or Gaustad node, I can assist you with your image analysis pipelines and encourage you to reach out.

### Contact Us
You can contact me via email at biphub-contact@medisin.uio.no to set up a meeting. Currently  I am dedicating a 50 % position to image analysis and if a lot of requests are made some priorities might be made.  I can work in several programming ImageJ, Python, Go, MATLAB and other programming languages, and have access to several powerful computers and software, that are needed for various challenges.
When you send an email it will automatically create a request in the request tracker, so please give an informative subject header to your email. And all requests must be submitted this way.
Please ensure that you include this information in your request:
1.	Your name and the name of your PI (Group Leader):
2.	The name of your imaging node (Montebello Node, Blindern Node, IMB node, or Gaustad node):
3.	A link to some example files (not the entire dataset if large):
4.	A detailed description of your problem and what you need assistance with:
5.	Should the generated code be available for the public?: (Yes/ No/ Only after yyyy.mm.dd/publication/etc)
